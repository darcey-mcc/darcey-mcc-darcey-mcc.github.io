			<h5>Introduction</h5>

			<p>
				To begin this project, I decided to focus on what software is necessary to create these platforms. To create the UniPal website, I will use the coding platform I am most familiar with in regards to HTML and CSS, which is atom and Github. I am
				unsure as of now if I want to use templates for this site, this will most likely depend on how much time pressure I am under.
				For the app, I have decided to use a program I used in school called Xcode. I am fairly familiar with the logistics of how the software itself works, however, I may have to brush up on the coding language it uses ( javascript). I have found a
				book I downloaded in school which essentially teaches you this code, so I will be completing a section of this book each day to remind myself of how the code works.
				In regards to the social media and aesthetic aspect of this prototype, I have decided to research what visual/ interactive cues are most effective on boys and girls between the ages of 18-25 who attend university as well as the psychology and
				mechanics involved when creating a successful social media outlet targeted towards mature youth.
				I have identified a few successful design precedents that are relevant to my prototype and will examine what made these designs so effective and discuss how you may implement these aspects into my own work.

			<h5>Preparation</h5>
			<p>
				After deciding the visual direction, I decided to figure out the task flow for both the app and website. Both platforms will have the same task flow and user flow layout, however they will be presented in different designs. This is to prevent
				a buildup of unecessary work, and to speed up the process of finishing my first prototype. I have created a few task flows for other courses I have/ am taking, so I fairly familiar with the amount of work and effort that needs to go into
				creating in one. I have used a few creative platforms such as adobe illustrator, figma and canva to make previous user flows, however I have found the website miro to be the most effective and efficient to use. Attached below is my userflow
				created in miro, which indicates how the user would go about navigating the social media outlet via website and app. the bubbles either represent an action, and the squares represent where that would lead the user.

					<h5>Visual direction</h5>
					<p>
						After creating the user task flow, I decided to start on creating the wireframes. I thought I had submitted my mood board in a previous post, however, it seems I forgot to. Attached below are a variety of website/ app interface designs I
						was inspired by when creating these first iterations of wireframes. I discovered these designs from both Pinterest, Behance and dribble.

						The use of contrast in these designs helped create a strong sense of intuitive navigation within the user. In many UX and UI designs, the principle “less is more” is often a critical aspect in creating successful interaction design. This
						is because when a person visits a website or app on a mobile device, they want to complete the task at hand as quickly as possible.

			<h5> wireframes completed </h5>
			<p>
				After completing my app wireframes, I felt there was no need to create initial physical sketches for my website wireframes. This is because I felt the precedents I was using were strong enough for me to create designs digitally, and I felt I
				had a stronger sense of intuition in creating an effective set of wireframes for this website.

							<h5> Prototype 1 </h5>
							<p>
								After completing both my app and website wireframes via figma, I decided the best course of action for the next stage of this project would be to start prototyping. Using the palette and visual direction I suggested in project 1, I
								finished my first batch of wireframes in roughly 2 days. The end result was not what I was hoping to go for aesthetically, however I felt relieved that I was able to start testing my prototype and move forward with improving certain
								aspects of it.

			<h5> Prototype 1 feedback </h5>
			<p>
				After presenting my designs to a handful of student testers between the ages of 19-25 who have to chosen to remain anonymous, I was given a large amount of feedback; both good and bad. The students liked the use of colour and felt that it
				brought a 'fun' aspect to the outlet, however they found both prototypes difficult to navigate. I was intrigued as to why they found this experience so difficult, so I decided to watch each tester use the interface and see where they would
				struggle. After observing their behaviour, I explained what I had noticed and whether they agreed with my statement.

				Furthermore, I discovered that the sizing for many aspects of the design was off, whether it be the typeface or the padding between certain shapes and buttons. The second discovery I made was that the user tended to read from left to right,
				and was rather thrown off by the central aspect of the designs. It seemed that the simpler the design, the more pleasant and efficient the experience was for the user.

				After these discoveries, I decided the best course of action was to keep prototyping, and work on new designs.
			</p>

			<h5> Prototype 2</h5>
			<p>
				After taking into consideration everything I had learnt and had been told to improve upon in my first round of testing, I created a new series of wire frames. I got rid of any unnecessary parts of the design which were added purely for the
				visual aesthetic and cut down the number of words I was using on each page. I enlarged the typeface on some pages. However, I only did this on pages on which this was needed. I created a more consistent overall design by sticking to only
				three font sizes, keeping the buttons the same colours and sizes ( for the majority, this excludes the homepage). I also forgot to add in the logo to the top right of my pages last time, so I was sure to include this in these designs.

				I felt rather satisfied with the final design and was ready to start my second round of testing.

			<h5> Prototype 2 feedback </h5>
			<p>
				After getting my testers to review the second round of my prototypes for both my app and website, I discovered there was still a lot more work and dedication that was needed to be implemented to ensure these interfaces were designed to the
				highest quality. There was a multitude of aspects which needed to be improved according to my testees.

				Firstly, many of the students thought that the padding between certain aspects of the design such as the 'create account', 'proof of study' and 'select profile' boxes were too small, which lead to the interface feeling cluttered and hard to
				read. Many agreed that the second round of prototypes was far more revised than the original iterations I presented to them. However, they still felt that there was that extra something missing from the overall visual aesthetic. I was curious
				as to what they thought could enhance my project, so I asked what I could do to fix this issue. A few suggested minimal yet funky graphics which related to my target audience, some even suggested adding live animations to the website. Due to
				the tight schedule I was under, I decided that the graphics were doable, however, the animations were not ( for now).

					<h5>Final</h5>
					<p>
						After taking into consideration everything stated in the previous journal entry, I decided to create my next round of prototypes on Figma. This took no more than half a day, as only a few aspects of both the app and website needed to be
						revised.

						For the website, I added more padding space to where the testers felt more "negative space" was needed, enlarged the image icon on the profile picture selection page, simplified the designs of the comment and like buttons on the explore
						page and added graphics to each page.

						For the app, I added a graphic to the homepage to fill up unnecessary negative space, increased the padding around the username on the user's profile page, added a graphic to the confession confirmation page, changed the button options
						for when the user wants to either reply and/or like a post and added functional buttons down the bottom of the user's screen as this was an aspect which was ignored in the first round of testing.

						These were all requests that were made by my testers, and I feel happy with my final results. Hopefully my users will also be satisfied with my improvements.
